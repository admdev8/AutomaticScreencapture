Automatic Screencapture
======================

Hardware/software for capturing screengrabs from VLC - created for a project commissioned by Rhizome.org (thanks!). Works by pausing your movie, takes a screenshot, advances by N frames (taking screenshots along the way), and starts the movie again!

Automatically takes control of VLC using a single button connected to an Arduino (for source code and schematic, see the 'ArduinoCode' portion).
 
This sketch uses the Java AWT 'robot' class, which allows you to create virtual keystrokes (automatic keyboard shortcuts in VLC).
